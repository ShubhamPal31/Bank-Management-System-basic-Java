# Bank-Management-System-basic-Java
 This repo has a simple basic code written in java that tries to stimulate the simple functionality of bank management consisting of three login types for customer , employee and admin.
 The entire code is written only in java and no other tech stack is used as this was my first task after learning Java and from this task I was able to understand the fundamentals of Java and how a basic stimulation of bank management can be done.
